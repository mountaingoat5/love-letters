		The only way to save us to always remember where we’ve come from. I never want to loose you and the rise of seeing you leave one day is too much for me to bear. I want us to “git init” our relationship so we can never forget the good times we’ve had. And if you don’t do it, I’ll make sure to “ls –la” and check that we do this together, or not at all. We can stack our memories, get them ready to save forever in our eternal love – “ git add &lt; thing.file &gt;”. The only way to see our progress is to “git statuse” and baby I swear if we don’t stage ourselves for the building project of a lifetime, Ill have no reason to live. 
		</p>
		<p>
		When we’ve made our memories, bought our houses, and written our history books and all is ready for an eternal timeless library of our existence “git commit –m ‘ comment’ ” and we will finally know what its like to live forever. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I want to see our family, our children, and our love at all stages, “git log” will show me a synopsis of our life together and if we ever want to relive our fantasies, it’s as simple as “ git checkout &lt; name.file &gt;”. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Baby, I know times can be tough, and sometimes I make mistakes, but the only way to keep our love pure and true is to pretend that it never happened and me must “git reset HEAD &lt; file.name &gt; if I need a new start down an old path, because we all need a little grace sometimes. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If things ever go really bad, I promise I will wipe everything clean and leave no trace of transgressions between us and I’ll “git add &lt; name.file &gt;” back to our repository of good affection so that no one, not even ourselves can find it again. Or, I can expedite the process through “git rm &lt; name.file &gt;”, which will be less painful for the both of us. 
			</p>
			<p>
			But my dear gut, what I love about you more than everything else is your ability to explore. I can see new people, new things, and you love me just the same, and all of our shared histories can be kept together of separate, all taking their own limb of our life to add the divine relationship we have. “git branch”, we can test our own limits with other lovers and create new stories, “git branch &lt; branchname &gt;” takes us to a world where we can only see the beautiful love of another, whole still be held by the love we feel for each other. 
			</p>
			<p>
			When we find lovers that must be all part of us, we can combine our affection in a single “git merge &lt; branchname &gt;” to whatever story we’re in at the time, and our reality builds form there. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I know sometimes, we’ll go too far. We’ll find another lover and forget the original love of foundation. And I regress, this has happened to me and the branch of trying to build something bigger or better with another, but it will die horrifically and there will not be any hope of saving a lost hope, drowned in poor decisions and lack of skill. In that case my love, I will ride of all memory of our unfaithfulness, and “git branch –D &lt; branchname &gt;”, never to be thought of again.
