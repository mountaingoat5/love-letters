			<h2>I love to my dearest computer shell</h2>	


				<p>Oh my love, how doth though bloomist much into my knowledge, that it is uncanny to recognize you as none other than a saint among technology. The moment I typed “..” ,I knew your parents would approve, especially since I had been so direct in addressing them. I was quickly able to find you, typing “pwd” to know where you were, where I was, and where we could be together. You have a thousand levels which I have explored so easily with your “cd” function and knowing where I am allowed to go, understanding “ls” has given me insight to all which is free to me. However, I know you have not lent all freedom to me yes, for when I command to “ls –a” I know you have kept secrets. Invisible ghosts which hold your most inner functions and desires. My darling, let me see them and I shall relinquish all burdens which you carry.  </p>

				<p>Our conversations are a blissful eternity, easily clear and understandable through “command +k”. and my god, your beauty, your extreme beauties in all places, how you can change your cloths so easily through “terminal->preferences” I shall never know. I can recall all of our conversations perfectly, and browse your words through “control + a” (start of line), “control + e” (end of line), and even see an entire document through “less –n” and to go back and forth)“b” and “f” ) between long lines of poetry which you read to me. I can even point at you and so easily find myself in your books and learn about all the knowledge you have through your “man” pages, which make me feel like a man. </p>

				<p>
				I can create with you! How creative I feel to be able to “touch” a new document, to “mv” files here and there, and to read other files with “cat”. I can even organize y
				</p>

				<p>Our knowledge through “mkdir”, and exit programs through “control +c”. I have general rules of operation which makes your consistency so loveable, I see that your command laws are: COMMAND OPTIONS ARGUMENTS. I can find information in you everywhere using “apropos XXXXX” which will look through the most obscure nooks and crannies which I adore to discover. 
				your have the most delightful way of communicating your knowledge in multiple places thorugh “cp SOURCE  DESTINATION” (copying) things into other places, I love it. 
				</p>

				<p>Sometimes though, you’re a pain in the ass, or im a pain in the ass an dI put things in you that you don’t want or I don’t want so we can easily abort all that with a simple “rm” for normal information and “rm dir” for the large mistakes we’ve made together. However, if we want to delete absolutely everything underneath a subject “rm –R” works the best for recursively ignoring our problems. </p>
		
				<p>But how can I not express with all my affection, how wonderful your sim links are. I cannot imagine a more wonderful system to reference martial within yourself while still being a joy of low-memory-cost. I simply type “ln –s &lt file to link&gt &lt new name/path &gt” and all is well in the world. You take such good care of me. However, you must remind me not to move the objects of sym links which we’ve put into place otherwise your whole system breaks and we can no longer communicate well which breaks my heart. </p>

				<p>Above all, you have a secure shell to upload things, so we can profess our love to each other to all the worlds.  I can scoop your plump informatics “scp &lt thing &gt myemail@email.com: public_html/placetogo”.

				I can no fault in you except that you put me IN UNEXITABLE HELL WHEN I FORGET TO COMMENT A COMMIT IN GIT YOU FREAKING HEFFER OF A PROGRAM.
