		<h2>git-ing it on</h2>
		<div class="ppp">
		<p> Since we met last week I think we’re in love. And I hate love, but I feel it must be true now. It is amazing to me how everything I make can be shared through you, it’s as if I didn’t exist to the coding world until now. All of my projects, commits, and branches can be seen and heck, I could even get a job one day if I post enough cool shit though you. How can I not adore your luscious amazingtastic fanfreakenstupndous self. Firstly: “git push” saves my life, that’s where the magic happens and we can really get things going. Secondly, I can see everyone else’s sweet code, and make sure that we can collaborate so I can sometimes even help google people with their work, because they obviously don’t know what they’re doing. It’s really neat to me that people can comment on my messages and commits, and to track what sort of coming I’m into and how it’s being used. Other people can even take my code and make something else super rad out of it and I won’t be even mad because most of my code so recycled from other people anyways. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I think your ability to “git stash” is also super sexy, because I don’t always way people to see my half-finished work on a commit, but I still want it to be backed up if I need to take a break in a project. I love that you’re free, because all valuable things are, and nothing says valuable like a free service, am I right? 
		</p>
		<p>
		I dig that you’ll let me open pull requests so my friends and people I’m working with can also get a sniff at what’s so good about you. This allows me to discuss and review my code with others who truly matter and can really help me get better. Plus, it’s like a giant git party in that we’re all worshiping the almighty git. FINALLY
		</p>
		<p>
		 I get to deploy. After many months of anticipations, I can use keywords to resolve errors and issues and finally be considered a coding master, what could be better? At the end of all this, I can make all my stuff and we’ll finally look like professionals who deserve sick, well paid coding jobs.
